# Proposed Photosensitive Epilepsy Guidelines - pseGuidelines
This guidance extends other international guidelines on photosensitive epilepsy hazards to accommodate changes in technologies and content formats since those guidelines were initially developed. The intent of this repository is to house guidelines that can be adopted and adapted by others, including standards bodies.
